# Website Portfolio

Welcome to my website portfolio! This website showcases my work and includes a contact form for visitors to reach out to me. The form data is sent directly to a **Telegram bot** using the **Telegram Bot API**. This website has been built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP** for form submission and Telegram integration.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **HTML** 
   - Used for structuring the content of the website, such as headings, paragraphs, forms, and links.

### 2. **CSS**
   - Applied to style the website, ensuring it has a clean, modern, and responsive design. Custom styles are used to enhance the layout and ensure the site looks great on all screen sizes.

### 3. **JavaScript**
   - Implemented to handle dynamic content, form validation, and interactivity. It ensures that the form is submitted correctly and provides instant feedback to the user.

### 4. **PHP**
   - Used for handling the backend form submission. When the user submits the contact form, PHP processes the data and sends it to a **Telegram bot** using the Telegram Bot API.

### 5. **Telegram Bot API**
   - Used to send form submissions to your Telegram bot. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to a pre-configured Telegram bot, and you receive the submission as a message in your Telegram.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts its layout according to the screen size, ensuring it looks good on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form that uses PHP to send form data to a Telegram bot.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used to validate the form input before submission and provides instant feedback to the user for errors or successful submission.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: The design is minimalist, focusing on providing a smooth user experience.
